# Redis Clone in C/C++

A simple Redis-like key-value store built in C/C++, created to explore how in-memory databases work under the hood.

## Key Features

- **Data Structures**: Implements Redis core data structures like strings, lists, hash maps, and sets.
- **Event Loop**: A basic single-threaded event loop to handle client requests in real-time.
- **Persistence**: In-memory data store with basic save functionality for persistence.
- **Multithreading**: Allows handling of multiple clients for concurrent connections.

## Getting Started

1. Clone and navigate to the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/piyus02v/redis.git
